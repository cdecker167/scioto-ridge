# Scioto Ridge -- NATIONAL CHAMPIONS üèÜ

- For the 2020-2021 BPA Web Application Team competition we were tasked with creating a web app capable of handling ride / restaurant reservations for a mock amusement park. We came up with the idea for our park, "Scioto Ridge", and created all of the content / branding for it. 

- The frontend of the site was created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The backend of the site consists of a MySQL database and a Node.js API.
