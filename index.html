		<p style='margin: auto 0; width: 35%;'><strong>The Food District: </strong>Stop by the Food District to refill and refuel. With so many options to choose from, there’s something for everyone to like. Chickens-R-Us fulfills your chicken crazings. Dogs to Go keeps it traditional with hot dogs and sodas. The Chuck Wagon is a blast from the past, serving hearty stews, beans, and other classic flavors. The Easy as Pie Diner takes you back to the 50s with their timeless diner look and food, we also recommend trying some of our award winning pie. Forever Cool Ice Cream offers our famous 100 flavor selection to cool you down and satisfy your sweet tooth.

			<strong>Xtreme at the Ridge:</strong> Our most daring section of the park, Xtreme at the Ridge is chocked full of thrilling attractions. Take a leap of faith off of our 1:3 Space Needle. If you’d rather be strapped into a chair, try our 15 story high swing set. Or set sail on the Scioto River in one of our various types of vessels. Perhaps you're a fan of fair rides, if so, try out the Cage Ride, a new and improved take on the classic fair ride. Maybe you idolize David & Goliath, try being the pebble in David’s sling shot as you get launched 280 ft into the air. But for our true thrill seekers, looking for only the most daring and extreme attractions, try the Roller Coaster. The signature attraction here at Scioto Ridge, the Roller Coaster combines high speeds and high heights as you race along the steel tracks.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Scioto Kiddy Land:</strong> For our young familys or just those who are still feeling blue from the Roller Coaster, don’t let the name deceive you, the Scioto Kiddy Land has something for everyone. Maybe you’re looking to relive the glory days in some antique models cars, if so, the Antique Cars are just for you. Or maybe something equally as classic, the good ol’ fashioned Merry-Go-Round. Perhaps you want a glimpse into the future, try out our brand new, state-of-the-art VR space exploration simulation ride, the Rocket Ship. Or take a break, relax, and enjoy the view from 120 ft on our Ferris Wheel.

			<strong>The Haunted Forest: </strong>When the sun is high, the forest is thriving, when the sun fades away, the haunted forest is unliving.
